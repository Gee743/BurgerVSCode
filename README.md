UClan Burger Ordering System üçî

- This project is a simple C++ console-based burger ordering system. It allows users to add credits, order burgers of various sizes, select additional toppings, and manage their credit balance. This was one of my first C++ projects and a fun way to practice basic programming concepts.

- How It Works

	1.	Start with a default credit balance of 100 credits.
	2.	Navigate the main menu to add credits or order a burger.
	3.	After selecting a burger size, you can choose from several optional toppings.
	4.	The program checks if the user has enough credits for the order.
	5.	After confirming the order, it displays the total cost and the remaining balance.
